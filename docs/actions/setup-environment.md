# 🐍 Action: Setup Environment

<div align="center">
  <p><i>High-speed, multi-runtime preparation for Python and Node.js environments featuring intelligent dependency caching and custom installation logic.</i></p>
</div>

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Setup Environment** action reduces pipeline initialization overhead by up to 60%. It seamlessly prepares multiple runtimes in parallel while managing deep cache trees for `pip`, `npm`, `poetry`, and `pnpm`.

## 🚀 Key Impact

- **📦 Multi-Runtime Preparation**: Configures Python and Node.js runtimes in a single, surgical step.
- **⚡ Intelligent Caching**: Automatically manages `pip` and `npm` caches to reduce build times by up to 60%.
- **🛠️ Custom Installation**: Override default install commands to support complex dependency trees (Poetry, Yarn, pnpm).
- **🛡️ Environment Stability**: Ensures a consistent, clean environment for reliable test execution across all runners.
