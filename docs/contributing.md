# 🤝 Contributing to QA Hub Actions

We welcome contributions! Whether it's adding a new action, improving documentation, or fixing a bug, your help is appreciated.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Add your Action**: Create a new folder with an `action.yml` and a `README.md`.
3.  **Documentation**: Add a corresponding `.md` file in `docs/actions/` and update `mkdocs.yml`.
4.  **Verification**: Ensure your action follows the composite action standards used in this repo.

## 🖋️ Documentation Style Guide

To maintain the "Premium" look of our wiki, please follow these standards:
- Use **Emojis** in headers to improve scannability.
- Include an **"At a Glance"** block at the top of every action page.
- Provide clear **Usage Examples** in YAML blocks.
- Use **Tables** for inputs and outputs.

## 🚀 Releasing

We use **Semantic Versioning**. PRs should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification to ensure automatic changelog generation and versioning.
