## 🚀 Key Impact

- **🏗️ Service Orchestration**: Seamlessly launches backend and frontend processes in the background for integrated testing.
- **🩺 Automated Health Checks**: Waits for specific endpoints to return `200 OK` before allowing the pipeline to proceed.
- **🔍 Debug Intelligence**: Automatically captures and prints service logs (`backend.log`, `frontend.log`) upon startup failure.
- **⚡ Performance-Focused**: Minimizes waiting time with configurable timeouts and intelligent retry logic.
